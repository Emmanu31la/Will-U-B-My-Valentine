💖 Will You Be My Valentine?

A cute, interactive, and responsive web application designed to ask that special someone the big question! This project features custom animations, sound effects, and a real-time notification system to let you know the moment they say "Yes!"


✨ Features
💌 Magic Link System: Create a unique link to send to your Valentine.

📱 Real-Time Notifications: Get notified instantly on your device via ntfy.sh when they respond.

🎭 Interactive Characters: Features dynamic character expressions that change based on user interaction (Happy, Sad, Heartbroken).

💔 Progressive "Yes" Button: The "Yes" button gets larger and the character gets sadder the more the user refuses.

🎵 Sound Effects: Cute audio feedback for interactions.

📱 Fully Responsive: Works perfectly on mobile phones and desktops.
